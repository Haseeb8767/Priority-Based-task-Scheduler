# Priority-Based-task-Scheduler 
(By Haseeb and  G sai charan )
#Overview of the Project:
#This project is basically a application of priority based task scheduler for a restaurant where we decide priority among the customers. 
   
The priority is determined based on:

1)Total cost of their order (higher total cost means higher priority),
2)Maximum preparation time of their items (shorter max prep time means higher priority),
3)Whether the customer is old or new (old customers are given priority over new ones).

The conditions are mentioned in priority wise like if for two customer condition 1 is same then it will checks for condition 2 ,and if condition 1 and condition 2 are same then checks for condition 3.
